Description: This package contains two functions, the euclidian() and the dijkstra(). The first performs an euclidean algorithm for two inputs x and y to find the greatest common divisor and the second uses the dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest paths between a vertex in a graph and all of the other vertices in it.
